<h1>Introduction</h1>
"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences" is a 1960 article written by the physicist Eugene Wigner, published in Communication in Pure and Applied Mathematics.[1][2] In it, Wigner observes that a theoretical physics's mathematical structure often points the way to further advances in that theory and to empirical predictions. Mathematical theories often have predictive power in describing nature.

<p class="titles">Observations and Arguments</p>

<p>Wigner argues that mathematical concepts have applicability far beyond the context in which they were originally developed. 
    He writes: "It is important to point out that the mathematical formulation of the physicist's often crude experience leads in an uncanny number of cases
     to an amazingly accurate description of a large class of phenomena."[3] He adds that the observation "the laws of nature are written in the language of mathematics," 
     properly made by Galileo three hundred years ago, "is now truer than ever before."</p>

<p>Wigner's first example is the law of gravitation formulated by Isaac Newton.

    Originally used to model freely falling bodies on the surface of the Earth, 
    this law was extended based on what Wigner terms "very scanty observations"[3] to describe the motion of the planets, 
    where it "has proved accurate beyond all reasonable expectations."[4] Wigner says that "Newton ... noted that the parabola 
    of the thrown rock's path on the earth and the circle of the moon's path in the sky are particular cases
     of the same mathematical object of an ellipse, and postulated the universal law of gravitation on the basis of a single, 
     and at that time very approximate, numerical coincidence."
</p>
<p>Wigner's second example comes from quantum mechanics: 
    Max Born "noticed that some rules of computation, given by Heisenberg, 
    <img class="profile-pic" src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTbfUOiI-pI8IRiBN37MPRGUnIxOgFgnruw1e2-kjaZk27s2zic">
    were formally identical with the rules of computation with matrices, 
    established a long time before by mathematicians. Born, Jordan, 
    and Heisenberg then proposed to replace by matrices the position a
    nd momentum variables of the equations of classical mechanics. 
    They applied the rules of matrix mechanics to a few highly idealized problems 
    and the results were quite satisfactory. However, there was, at that time, 
    no rational evidence that their matrix mechanics would prove correct under more realistic conditions." 
    But Wolfgang Pauli found their work accurately described the hydrogen atom: 
    "This application gave results in agreement with experience." 
    The helium atom, with two electrons, is more complex, but 
    "nevertheless, the calculation of the lowest energy level of helium, 
    as carried out a few months ago by Kinoshita at Cornell and by Bazley at the Bureau of Standards, 
    agrees with the experimental data within the accuracy of the observations, which is one part in ten million. 
    Surely in this case we 'got something out' of the equations that we did not put in." 
    The same is true of the atomic spectra of heavier elements.
</p>
<p>Wigner's last example comes from quantum electrodynamics: 
    "Whereas Newton's theory of gravitation still had obvious connections with experience, 
    experience entered the formulation of matrix mechanics only in the refined or sublimated 
    form of Heisenberg's prescriptions. The quantum theory of the Lamb shift, as conceived by 
    Bethe

    and established by Schwinger, is a purely mathematical theory and the only direct 
    contribution of experiment was to show the existence of a measurable effect. 
    The agreement with calculation is better than one part in a thousand."
</p>
<p>There are examples beyond the ones mentioned by Wigner. 
    Another often cited example is Maxwell's equations, 
    derived to model the elementary electrical and magnetic phenomena 
    known in the mid-19th century. The equations also describe radio waves, 
    discovered by David Edward Hughes in 1879, around the time of James Clerk Maxwell's death.
